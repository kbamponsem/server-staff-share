Config
------

The project uses an easy configuration system which makes it very easy
to setup. When you clone this project, it would have a ``.env.example``
file. Copy and rename it to ``.env``. The ``.env.example`` contains a
structure of the expected environment variables required to setup.

::

   .
   ├── features
   ├── .env
   └── .env.example

The ``.env`` variables will be automatically be set when you start the
application.
